				<h4><strong>What is an Incident?</strong></h4>
				<p>An incident is an unplanned event which is a threat to the
					security of the organisation or may cause disruption of IT or
					business services reducing its quality and productivity. e.g.</p>
				<ul class="inline">
					<li>  Denial of service attack.</li>
					<li>  Unauthorized access etc.</li>
					<li>  looking for intruder activity
						on other parts of the network.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><strong>Incident Management</strong></h4>
				<p>Incident Management works to include the services and
					functions like vulnerability handling, artifact handling, security
					awareness training, and the other services.</p>

				<h4><strong>Objective</strong></h4>
				<p>To restore service operation with minimum interruption to the
					business in least amount of time possible. It should also prevent
					the re-occurrence of the events.</p>

				<h4><strong>Goals</strong></h4>
				<ol>
					<li>  Decreasing downtime, thus
						maximizing business productivity.</li>
					<li>  Resolving incidents before
						they can adversely impact business operations.</li>
					<li>  To leverage existing
						knowledge to speed up resolution.</li>
					<li>  Cost reduction associated
						with both IT service delivery and IT support.</li>
					<li>  Reduction of the adverse
						effect on business operations which might potentially cause loss
						of revenue, reputation, or even customers.</li>
					<li>  The ability to identify, and
						act on, opportunities to improve IT services and IT service
						delivery.</li>
				</ol>
